# About
Z Video Wallpaper is a video wallpaper(as the name implies ;P) for windows 8, 8.1 and 10. It is a C# form application based project. Simply it draws one of the forms on the background level which contains wmp control. Please note that I'm not working on this seriously so it might contain a few(most likely a lot of) bugs.

## Known Bugs
-If program gets terminated while loading the media background stays white/black.  
-If program gets terminated by task manager again background stays white/black.  
+Fix: Restarting the app and closing corretly or restarting "explorer.exe"
